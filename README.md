# TODO App
The Idea is to learn basics of Flask and web development using flask.
The repository has files for development of TO DO Lists.
THe HTML files will act as templates of webpges.
The py files will act as back end to get input and process the data and put or get from an SQLite DB.

## All web page templates at [templates](templates/)

## css at [CSS](static/css)

## JS at [JS](static/js)

## Main backend: [App](app.py)
